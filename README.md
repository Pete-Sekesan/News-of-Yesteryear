## About The Project

[<img src="images/readme-images/noy-gif.gif" alt="Logo" width="600" height="400">](https://pete-sekesan.github.io/News-of-Yesteryear/)

Back when I was in middle school, I loved going to the library and asking for various years of microfilm (am I dating myself here?) to put into the machine and just scroll though countless newspapers. I thought it was so cool to be able to look back and see news and headlines from major world events to just normal days, like maybe the day I was born.

I wanted to create an easy way for people to look up topics in old newspapers. I found the that Library of Congress has a massive online digitized database of these to scroll through. With my app, you can enter search topics and you will get back a scan of paper pertaining to that topic. From there you can click on the image, or on the "More Information" link that will take you to the Library of Congress's archive where you can take a much deeper dive into the article.
