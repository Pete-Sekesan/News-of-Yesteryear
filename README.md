Back when I was in middle school, I loved going to the library and asking for various years of microfilm (am I dating myself here?) to put into the machine and just scroll though countless newspapers. I thought it was so cool to be able to look back and see news and headlines from major world events to just normal days, like maybe the day I was born. 

I wanted to create an easy way for people to look up topics in old newspapers. I found the that Library of Congress has a massive online digitized database of these to scroll through. With my app, you can enter search topics and you will get back a scan of paper pertaining to that topic. From there you can click on the image, or on the "More Information" link that will take you to the Library of Congress's archive where you can take a much deeper dive into the article.

I've also included a History Quote Generator that displays an historical quote on the landing page, and then refreshes with a new one upon each search. Use these as little tokens of inspiration or even write some down to be used later. This is powered by the BestQuotes RapidAPI API.

Use this app for fun and to kill some time or for use on a research paper or article you are writing. Find a quote you like that us generated and use it in your next trivia night.
