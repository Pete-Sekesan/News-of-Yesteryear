Welcome to the News of Yesteryear App

Back when I was in middle school, I loved going to the library and asking for various years of microfilm (am I dating myself here?) to put into the machine and just scroll though countless newspapers. I thought it was so cool to be able to look back and see news and headlines from major world events to just normal days, like maybe the day I was born. 

I wanted to create an easy way for people to look up topics in old newspapers. I found the that Library of Congress has a massive online digitized database of these to scroll through. With my app, you can enter search topics and you will get back a scan of paper pertaining to that topic. From there you can click on the image, or on the "More Information" link that will take you to the Library of Congress's archive where you can take a much deeper dive into the article.

I've also included a History Quote Generator that displays an historical quote on the landing page, and then refreshes with a new one upon each search. Use these as little tokens of inspiration or even write some down to be used later.

Use this app for fun and to kill some time or for use on a research paper or article you are writing. Find a quote you like that us generated and use it in your next trivia night.

Requirements
The API hack capstone is largely open-ended. You'll choose at least 1, but preferably multiple APIs to work with and come up with an app that does something interesting with the data from those APIs. Ultimately, the user experience is up to you. The high-level requirements for your app are as follows:

The app should do something interesting: The overarching UX (user experience) requirement for this app is that it pulls in data from third party APIs and displays that data in some way to your user. It's up to you to figure out how to make this experience feel compelling to the user, and who it is that you want to make something interesting for. If you choose to work with only 1 API, you must do something with the data to present it in an original or interesting way.
Polished appearance for final version: Initially, you'll implement a minimal, functional prototype of your app, which you'll use to get feedback on your app's features. While the first version should not be polished, the final version you submit should be. We'll go into greater detail about what this means in the checkpoint dedicated to styling your app.
Refer to this design checklist for help.
Responsive: The final version of your app should work on both mobile and desktop.
Refer back to your responsiveness checklist for help.
Accessibility: The final version of your app must follow a11y best practices.
Take a moment to review the full rubric that your capstone will be scored on. You should refer back to this rubric as you plan and build your project. Before submitting your project for a formal code review, you should go through this rubric with your mentor to ensure you've met all the requirements.
